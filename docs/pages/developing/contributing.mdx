# Contributing to Plane

Plane is [developed on GitHub](https://github.com/drifting-in-space/plane), primarily by the
[Drifting in Space](https://driftingin.space/) team.

We accept code contributions, as long as they are aligned with our roadmap and vision for Plane.

Before you start working on large PR, we recommend opening an issue to discuss whether it fits the
roadmap, and whether we have any planned work that would overlap or conflict with your feature.

## Merge prerequisites

We run automated checks against every PR opened. When a PR is submitted for review, these tests
must pass before being merged.

These checks are:
- Tests must pass, including integration tests. See [Developing Plane)(../developing.mdx) for instructions
  on running tests.
- Clippy should not identify new issues. Run `cargo clippy` to check this.
- The code must be formatted. Run `cargo fmt` to format it in-place.
